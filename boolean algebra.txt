Q1)What are the possible values a boolean variable can take?
A1)The possible values a boolean variable can take are true or false.

Q2)What are the values a boolean expression can resolve to?
A2)A boolean expression can resolve to TRUE or False.

Q3)3.	What is the difference between the following sets of operators:
a.	&& , &
b.	|| , |
Which of these is called the short circuit operators?
A3) difference between && and &
both the operator performs the same work and will give the same result .but when we use the && it saves a lot of time .AND operator will be false if one value is false.
eg if((4 > 5) && (7 > 6))
as the first expression is false so the result will be false.the && opeartor will not not check the second expression.but if we are using the & operator.it will check the result 
of second expression.Thus && saves time.
Same is the case with || and |.if the first expression is true || operator will assign true value.
the && and || are short circuit operators

Q5)What are the most common situations where the circuit operators are used?
A5)Circuit operators are generally used when we have to check the conditions.like in the programme of grades i have used the && operator to gove the grades according to the marks obtained.
e.g if we have to assign grade D for marks 35 to 49 only then we can use && operator .
if(marks > 35 && marks < 49)
we used && here because we want both the condition to be satisfied.

Q6)In a program, typically where are boolean expressions used?
boolean expression are used with conditional statement in programming.

Q7)Does java have support for a ‘boolean’ data type?
A7)the boolean is a primitive data type in java which can take the value true or false.

6)In the simple interest program, in the expression keep an int to the left and all floats to the right. Why does the program not compile.
Points to ponder: What are narrowing conversions?
In the simple interest programme.when we keep int on left and float on right.we should do narrow conversion.for doing narrow conversion we 
should write(int) before the expression.it should be done explicitly.A narrowing conversion changes a value to a data type that might not be 
able to hold some of the possible values
for eg converting float to int.
eg converting 50.5 to int.we can only save 50 in int.

8)Write a program that has the following declaraion:  byte b = 09;
Points to ponder: How do you define numbers of base 16 (Hex) and numbers of base 8 in Java?
hexadecimal numbers are written by placing 0x before them. For example, 0x100 means 'the hexadecimal number 100' (=256 in decimal).
Literals with a leading zero are octal literals. Any number prefixed with a 0 is considered octal. Octal numbers can only use digits 0-7.

9)With reference to the program where PI id defined as a constant. What is the naming convention of the constant variable?
to define variable as constant in java.we use final .the naming convention followed is that the name should be in the uppercase with the underscore separating the word.
I have defined it as P_I.

Modify the above question defining PI as a constant. What are the advantages of using constants rather than hard-coding string literals in the code?
if we have to make changes we can make the change in single place if we are using final.but if we are using hard-coding we have to change it all positions

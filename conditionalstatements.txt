8)What do you mean by nesting? What are the rules related to nested blocks of code?
Upto what level can blocks be nested?
A8)In programming nesting is when information is organized in layer.It reduces the amount of code needed, while making it simple for 
a programmer to debug and edit. Different types of construct can be nested within another. For example, selection can be nested within 
a condition-controlled loop.
Nested block of code should not be left empty.there should not be any unreached code.
There is no depth limit for a nested loop.
It would be according to the demand of a specific program.

9)Can you write a switch case based on the value of a string variable?
In a switch statement, can default be placed at the top instead of at the bottom? Why is it usually placed at the top?
 What do you understand by idioms in a programming language?
A9)We can write a switch case based on the value of a string variable.Comparison of Strings in switch statement is case sensitive.
we can place default anywhere in the switch statement.
default is mostly written at the bottom.Adding a 'default' label at the end of every 'switch' statement makes the code clearer and 
guarantees that any possible case where none of the labels matches the value of the control variable will be handled.
A programming idiom is the usual way to code a task in a specific language. For example a loop is often written like this in C
for (i=0; i<10; i++)
in php we will write it like this
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++)

7)Provide your comments on this code:
if ( i<50 && i>100 ) System.out.println(“Hello”);
In the above expression, the if statement did not have braces. When should braces be put? when can they be avoided?
braces plays a vital role when we are using logical operator we should use it when we have many conditions.it is more readible.in this case it will work fine even without braces
eg if we want to print hello if the number is between 50 to 100 or from 200 to 250
then it would be
if((no>=50 && no<=100) || (no >= 200 && no<=250))
{
System.out.println("Hello");
}
in this the braces becomes very important.the compiler first do the evaluation of first expression and the desired result is obtained.
